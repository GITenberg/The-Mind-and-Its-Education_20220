description: '"The book aims to provide readers with a general introduction to psychology
  and its importance in educating the developing person. The author''s aim is to elucidate
  the fundamental truths of psychology, and he describes three ways in which he tries
  to accomplish this goal. First, the attempt has been made to present only fundamental
  truths; Second, the aim has been to state these fundamental truths simply, that
  the student may clearly understand them; Third, it is recognized that if the student
  is really to make use of the psychology he learns, he must have practical and useful
  truths presented to him, and must be led to a comprehension of these truths through
  their relation to his own actual experience. The various exercises suggested at
  the ends of the chapters will be found useful not because they outline the respective
  chapters in any systematic way, but because they will encourage introspection."
